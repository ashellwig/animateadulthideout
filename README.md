AdultHideout
============

*Hentai Addon for Kodi*
The **one and only** official site for this Repo is [this](https://github.com/ashellwig/animatedadulthideout) Github Page.
If you find my Repo somewhere else, he/she has nothing to do with me.

What it is
----------

This is a fork of [Adulthideout](https://github.com/Vashiel/repository.adulthideout) which esentially just removes anything that is not hentai,
with more being added whenever I remember that I had forked this.
